=== 6.3 Management of Infrastructure High Availability, Continuity Plans
==== 6.3.1 High Availability

High availability is a critical requirement for any production system. It ensures that the system is operational and accessible to users at all times. To achieve high availability, the following measures will be implemented:

- Redundancy: Critical components of the system will be duplicated to eliminate single points of failure. Redundant servers, databases, and network connections will be deployed to ensure continuous operation.

- Load Balancing: Load balancers will be used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This helps prevent overloading of individual servers and ensures that the system can handle a large number of requests.

- Auto-scaling: Auto-scaling capabilities will be implemented to automatically adjust the system's capacity based on traffic load. This helps ensure that the system can handle fluctuations in traffic without manual intervention.

- Monitoring: Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana will be used to monitor the system's performance and health. Alerts will be set up to notify the operations team of any issues that require immediate attention.

- Disaster Recovery: A disaster recovery plan will be developed to ensure that the system can be restored in case of a disaster. Backup copies of data will be stored offsite to protect against data loss.

By implementing these measures, the system will be able to achieve high availability and ensure continuous operation for users.

==== 6.3.2 Continuity Plans

Continuity plans are essential to ensure that the system can recover from unexpected events and continue to operate without interruption. The following continuity plans will be implemented:

- Business Continuity Plan: A business continuity plan will be developed to ensure that critical business functions can continue in case of a disaster. This plan will outline the steps to be taken to restore operations and minimize downtime.

- Incident Response Plan: An incident response plan will be developed to address security incidents, data breaches, and other unexpected events. This plan will outline the steps to be taken to contain and mitigate the impact of incidents.

- Backup and Restore Plan: A backup and restore plan will be developed to ensure that data can be restored in case of data loss or corruption. Regular backups will be taken and tested to ensure data availability.

- Communication Plan: A communication plan will be developed to ensure that stakeholders are informed of any incidents or disruptions. This plan will outline the communication channels to be used and the information to be shared.

By implementing these continuity plans, the system will be able to recover from unexpected events and continue to operate without interruption.
