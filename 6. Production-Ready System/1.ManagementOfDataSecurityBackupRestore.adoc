=== 6.1 Management of Data Security, Backup, and Restore 
==== 6.1.1 Data Security

Data security is a critical aspect of any system. It ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. To ensure data security, the following measures will be implemented:

- Encryption: Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to control access to data based on user roles and permissions.
- Audit Logging: All data access and modification activities will be logged for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- Data Masking: Sensitive data will be masked to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Regular Security Audits: Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

==== 6.1.2 Backup and Restore Strategies

Data backup and restore strategies are essential to ensure data availability and integrity. The following strategies will be implemented:

- Regular Backups: Regular backups of data will be taken to ensure that data can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.
- Offsite Backups: Backup copies of data will be stored offsite to protect against data loss due to disasters such as fire, flood, or theft.
- Backup Testing: Regular testing of backups will be conducted to ensure that data can be restored successfully.
- Backup Retention: Backup copies will be retained for a specified period to meet data retention requirements.
- Disaster Recovery Plan: A disaster recovery plan will be developed to ensure that data can be restored in case of a disaster.
