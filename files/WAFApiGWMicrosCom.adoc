==== 3.1.1 Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Before any request reaches our API Gateway, it first traverses a Cloudflare **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**. The WAF inspects incoming traffic, blocking malicious or malformed requests and protecting the system against threats like **SQL injections**, **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and **denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks. Only valid requests passing WAF checks are forwarded to the API Gateway.

==== 3.1.2 API Gateway
After the WAF, requests arrive at the **API Gateway**, the central entry point for all client traffic. The API Gateway handles:

* **Authentication and authorization** – It verifies client credentials or tokens (obtained from Keycloak) before granting access.
* **Token forwarding** – Once Keycloak issues an access token, the client includes it in subsequent requests. The API Gateway forwards this token to the target microservice. Each microservice uses Keycloak’s **public keys** to validate the token.
* **Routing** – It directs requests to the appropriate microservice based on request paths or rules.
* **Rate limiting** – It prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe.
* **Monitoring and logging** – All incoming and outgoing requests are logged for future analysis, debugging, and auditing.

By preventing direct access to microservices, the API Gateway adds a layer of security, ensuring microservices remain behind the gateway and are never directly exposed to the public internet.

==== 3.1.3 Communication Protocols and Service Mesh
For inter-service calls, microservices communicate over **HTTP/REST**, making them straightforward to develop and integrate. Each microservice exposes a RESTful API, enabling flexible and decoupled service interactions.

**Service discovery** is managed via **Kubernetes DNS**, allowing services to be reached through resolvable names like `channel-service.beep.svc.cluster.local`.

To secure and observe internal service communication, **Linkerd** is deployed as the **Service Mesh**. Linkerd provides:

* **mTLS (Mutual TLS)** – Automatically encrypts and authenticates inter-service traffic. When a microservice calls another, Linkerd sidecar proxies transparently handle encryption and certificate validation, ensuring that only trusted services can communicate.
* **Mesh-enabled Ingress** – Both the ingress controller (Traefik) and the API Gateway (Kong or another) can be “meshed,” meaning all traffic within the cluster is secured by mTLS.
* **Observability** – By default, Linkerd gathers metrics for success rates, latencies, and request volumes, enhancing visibility.
* **Resilience** – Features like retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking can be configured to handle communication failures gracefully.

Through Linkerd, each microservice benefits from end-to-end encryption and service-to-service authentication, creating a secure and reliable mesh for internal communication.

==== 3.1.4 Service Mesh POC
The service mesh proof of concept (POC) is implemented using Linkerd, a lightweight service mesh designed for Kubernetes. It provides features like mTLS, observability, and traffic management.
The app is a simple page that displays a random fun compliment.
To see more details about the POC you can read the POC's README.md.
A live proof of concept (POC) of the system is accessible at the following addresses:

* Application frontend: http://compliments.162.38.112.221.nip.io/
* Linkerd dashboard: http://linkerd-dashboard.162.38.112.221.nip.io/
* Direct access to Traefik metrics/traffic: http://linkerd-dashboard.162.38.112.221.nip.io/namespaces/traefik/deployments/traefik

You can refresh the page to see some changes in the dashboard. 

The domain resolution is handled via **nip.io**, a free wildcard DNS service that maps subdomains to IP addresses automatically. This enables quick setup and access to services using predictable URLs without manual DNS configuration.

The diagram below illustrates a typical flow where a user makes a request that involves authentication via Keycloak, forwarding of the token by the API Gateway, and an internal microservice call secured by Linkerd’s mTLS.
