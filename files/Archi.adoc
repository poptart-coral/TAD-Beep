==== Overview

The Beep application is composed of several independent microservices that expose REST APIs, orchestrated behind an API gateway. Each service has its own dedicated database. The application also includes a standalone WebRTC service used directly by the frontend for real-time communication.

==== Components

===== Frontend
- Implemented in React
- Communicates with backend services via the API gateway (Kong)
- Interacts directly with the WebRTC service for media connections

===== API Gateway
- **Kong** is used to route HTTP(S) requests to the various microservices
- Performs authentication and token validation

===== Microservices
Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain and owns its data:

- **Notification API**
* Handles user notifications
* Backed by its own `Notif DB`

- **Permission API**
* Manages access controls and user roles
* Backed by `Permission DB`

- **Server API**
* Manages user-created servers or groups
* Backed by `Server DB`

- **Channel API**
* Handles channels inside servers
* Backed by `Channel DB`

-  **Friend API**
* Manages friend requests and social graph
* Backed by `Friend DB`

- **Message API**
* Manages messaging functionality between users
* Backed by `Message DB`

===== WebRTC Service
- A separate service used for establishing peer-to-peer media connections
- Not exposed through Kong, it is accessed directly by the frontend using WebRTC protocols
